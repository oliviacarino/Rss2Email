A small program capable of aggregating content from multiple RSS/Atom feeds and mailing them to you
in a practical summary email. Keep track of your favorite blogs that don't feature an update
newsletter or similar service.

## Dependencies

You'll need [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/) or [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed to
compile this software.

## Installation

Each release automatically publishes Docker images for
[x86](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/antoniosbarotsis/rss2email-x86) and
[arm](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/antoniosbarotsis/rss2email-arm) on DockerHub.
Note that these can only run on AWS Lambda. If you want to run them elsewhere through Docker, read
[here](https://github.com/AntoniosBarotsis/Rss2Email/wiki/4.-More-on-Docker).

Alternatively, you can build this from source. Clone this repository and run:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

Check out the
[build from source](https://github.com/AntoniosBarotsis/Rss2Email/wiki/1.-Home#building-from-source)
section of the wiki for more information.

## Configuration

**Rss2email** requires some environment variables to work. These can be provided either in your
shell or as entries in a `.env` file.

- `EMAIL_ADDRESS`: the mail address you will receive the feed content
- `DAYS`: this value indicates up to how many days in the past we go to search for entries  

- `FEEDS`: a list of semicolon-separated feed URLs.  
  _eg:_ `"https://blog.rust-lang.org/feed.xml;https://www.linux.org/articles/index.rss"`

- `EMAIL` (optional, defaults to `SendGrid`):  Which provider to use to send the email.  
  Can be set to `EMAIL_COMMAND` as an alternative if you have `mail` or `sendmail` installed in
  your system  

- `API_KEY` (optional): Your [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/) authentication key.

More details are available in the 
[Running the code](https://github.com/AntoniosBarotsis/Rss2Email/wiki/3.-Running-the-Code) wiki 
section.

## Usage

Running the code in debug mode won't send any emails and will instead output the generated HTML in
the console.

```bash
cargo run
```

It is recommended to try this out first and make sure that all your feeds and config variables are
correctly set up.

Running the project in release mode will send the emails

```bash
./target/release/Rss2email
# or
cargo run --release
```
